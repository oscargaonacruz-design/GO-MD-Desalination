## 🧬 Description

This repository provides the LAMMPS input data, force field parameters, and analysis scripts used to investigate the coupled influence of interlayer spacing and pore width on the desalination performance of multilayer graphene oxide (GO) membranes.

Simulations were performed using:
- **LAMMPS** molecular dynamics package  
- **OPLS-AA** force field for GO  
- **TIP3P** water model  
- Operating pressure: 300 atm applied through a graphene piston  

The data allow for the reproduction of the main structural and transport analyses, including water flux, ion rejection, and interlayer evolution.
