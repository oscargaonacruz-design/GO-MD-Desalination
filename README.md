# GO-MD-Desalination

This repository contains molecular dynamics simulation data and input files used in the study:

**Optimization of Interlayer Spacing and Pore Structure in Multilayer Graphene Oxide Membranes via Pressure-Driven Molecular Dynamics Simulations**  
*by Oscar Javier Gaona, Jesús David González Acosta, Álvaro González García, Luis Leonardo Camargo Ariza, and Jorge Gómez Rojas.*



##  Description

This repository provides the LAMMPS input data, force field parameters, and analysis scripts used to investigate the coupled influence of interlayer spacing and pore width on the desalination performance of multilayer graphene oxide (GO) membranes.

Simulations were performed using:
- **LAMMPS** molecular dynamics package  
- **OPLS-AA** force field for GO  
- **TIP3P** water model  
- Operating pressure: 300 atm applied through a graphene piston  

The data allow for the reproduction of the main structural and transport analyses, including water flux, ion rejection, and interlayer evolution.
